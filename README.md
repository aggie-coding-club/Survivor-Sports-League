# Starter Fantasy App

Welcome to the Starter Fantasy app! This app is similar to fantasy football but intended for the more casual sports audience.

## Project Overview

The Starter Fantasy app allows users to create and join leagues where they can compete against friends and AI opponents based on weekly sports matchups. Each user picks a sports team to win each week, and the challenge is that no team can be picked more than once during the regular season. By the end of the season, users will have the chance to make playoff predictions and gain additional points. The user with the most points at the end of the season wins the league.

## Current Goal

Our goal by the end of this semester is to have a functional version of the app running locally. Key features include:

- A working **sign-up system** (local model for now, bypassing advanced authentication).
- Ability for users to **create a league** and invite AI opponents to participate.
- Implementing the **core game mechanics** of survivor picks and league standings.
- Extracting and utilizing **real-time sports data** via API integration to generate matchups.

## Future Vision

We plan to continuously develop and expand on this project over time.
While we are currently focusing on the core features for this semester, we are excited about the potential for future enhancements such as:
- New ways to interact with the app
- Additional sports leagues
- More advanced user engagement features.
